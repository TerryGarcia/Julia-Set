# Julia Set
## What is it?
From Wikipedia: "In the context of complex dynamics, a topic of mathematics, the Julia set and the Fatou set are two complementary sets (Julia 'laces' and Fatou 'dusts') defined from a function. Informally, the Fatou set of the function consists of values with the property that all nearby values behave similarly under repeated iteration of the function, and the Julia set consists of values such that an arbitrarily small perturbation can cause drastic changes in the sequence of iterated function values. Thus the behavior of the function on the Fatou set is 'regular', while on the Julia set its behavior is 'chaotic'." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set

## Running the program
The program generates an image of the Julia Set with the specified settings. There is a settings section near the top of the file which has some options you can change.

This Julia Set was created by using -0.726895347709114071439 and 0.188887129043845954792 for C's real and imaginary components, respectively.
